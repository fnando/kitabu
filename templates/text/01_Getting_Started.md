## Getting Started

This guide is designed for beginners who want to get started with Kitabu from
scratch. However, to get the most out of it, you need to have some prerequisites
installed:

- The [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) interpreter version 3.2 or newer.
- The [PrinceXML](http://princexml.com) converter version 14.0 or newer.

### Installing Ruby

To install Ruby, consider using [RVM](http://rvm.io) or
[rbenv](http://rbenv.org), both available for Mac OSX and Linux distros. If
you're running a Windows, well, I can't help you. I don't even know if Kitabu
runs over Windows boxes, so if you find any bugs, make sure you
[let me know](http://github.com/fnando/kitabu/issues).

### Installing PrinceXML

[PrinceXML](http://princexml.com) is the best HTML to PDF converter available.
You can use advanced CSS features to style your book in any way you want. But
good things don't come for free, and PrinceXML is no exception. The Professional
License, which you grant you a installation on a single computer by a single
user costs 495USD. If you don't like the price tag, consider using
[DocRaptor](http://docraptor.com) when you're ready to publish your book.

To install PrinceXML, go to the website and download the correct version for
your platform; you can choose from Mac OSX, to Linux and Windows.

### Installing Calibre

[Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) is a e-book manager that, among other
features, allows converting ePub files into .mobi files.

To install Calibre, go to the website and download the correct version for your
platform; you can choose from Mac OSX, to Linux and Windows.
