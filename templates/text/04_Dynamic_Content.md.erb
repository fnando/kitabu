## Dynamic Content

Sometimes you may find useful to generate content dynamically. Maybe you're
going to read some configuration file, or maybe you just want to define some
helpers. Kitabu has support for ERb files; all you need to do is naming your
text file as `.md.erb`.

On the previous chapter, we listed all supported Rouge lexers. To do that, I
created a helper that looks like this:

```ruby
<%= File.read("./config/helpers.rb") %>
```

To use it, I just needed to add `<%%= lexers_list %>` to my text file. This
allows you to create anything you need!

### Escaping ERb code

If you want to write a book about Rails, you're likely to use lots of ERb tags.
In this case, make sure you escape the `<%% %>` and `<%%= %>` markers as
`<%%% %>` and `<%%%= %>`; otherwise you'll have a syntax error.

```
<%%%= Date.today %>
```
